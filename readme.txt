Replaces Gravatars with Libravatars in your WordPress installation.

== Description ==

Replaces Gravatars with [Libravatars](http://www.libravatar.org/) in your WordPress installation.
Libravatar is an alternative to Gravatar and its API is mostly compatible.

**Warning!** The plugin is incompatible with it's predecessor, the
**[Libravatar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/libravatar/)** plugin. Please remove or disable it before installing this plugin.

== Installation ==

Just extract the plugin directory into your *wp-content/plugins* directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are the requirements of this plugin? =
PHP 5.2.4, WordPress 4.3.

The plugin is tested down to WordPress 2.8 but I will not support anything but current and prevoius releases.
The plugin will not work under WordPress 2.7 and earlier.

Please also add
a [persistent caching plugin](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache#Persistent_Caching)
to increase performance.
